Tutorial for Github...

Everybody! 
I know you can believe in yourself!
If you believe in yourself you will know how to ride a bike
If you don't, you just keep practicing
Everybody! 

You will get the hang of it
I know it!
You will get better and better
I know it!
If you keep practicing, you can get better and better as you do it

I feel, I feel
I feel happy of myself
Happy of myself

Give me some thumbs up

Thumbs up, everybody, for rock and roll!
